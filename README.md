# Retention-Calculator-ERS
Greetings, my name is Eric RÃ­os Soderman. I coded a retention calculator in a Jupyter Notebook for academic institutions in general. I have a technical version for coders, and I am also hosting the user versions in English and Spanish here on Github. This tool is free, and not for sale.
