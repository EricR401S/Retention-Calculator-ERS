# Retention-Calculator-ERS
Greetings, my name is Eric RÃ­os Soderman. I coded a retention calculator in a Jupyter Notebook for academic institutions in general. I have a technical version for coders, and I am also hosting the user versions in English and Spanish here on Github. This tool is free, and not for sale. 

I also want to add that I tested the code by making up ficticious data, from the cohort to the graduation data. However, said data was tailored to mimic the format of the data from the institution I work in. With my overall experience from working with cohorts for 3 years, I have a very accurate sense of how cohorts are identified and how student retention is calculated.
