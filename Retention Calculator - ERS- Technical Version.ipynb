    "# Retention calculator, simplifying retention for academic institutions\n",

    "## Introduction on Problem: Time and Human Resource \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Greetings, my project here was designed to address the various academic units' difficulty in calculating cohort retention due to time and resource constraints. For a quick overview on the terminology, a cohort is a group of students designated according to a varied set of specific criteria and are often identified by their entry year. Each cohort's retention is evaluated by taking the members of the cohort who successfully enrolled in the following semester and/or graduated during the academic year. Then the amount of members retained are divided by the overall cohort's total denominator. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### As for explaining the problem, there are a total of four statisticians in the institution, spread across three different units. One of the more difficult reports to generate is the retention data for 7 or 8 cohorts according to a timeline. Despite using a combination of microsoft excel and access, it remains a very time consuming task, 2 weeks to a full month, of trying to identify the semesters in which multiple cohorts' students enrolled or graduated, besides juggling our other reports. The second problem is a lack of resource. Since we statisticians are spread across different units, we don't have the flexibility to help each other when we work with this report. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Solution: Retention Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First, the user's cohort file is turned into a list of lists. Then an instantiation of a cohort class and its attributes is run to identify key student identification and cohort columns in the user's cohort file. The following steps, dependent on user submitted enrollment data, append a 1, 0 and 2 for enrollment, non-enrolled, and graduation respectively to the user's cohort file. In addition, the user names the terms of the retention timeline and defines the graduation dates for them in a graduation dictionary. The reasoning is to provide flexibility; for example, my institution has two graduation dates for the first academic term, september and december or january. The final step is the calculator itself. It uses a nested index finder function and a dictionary-based function to tally the numbers according to the correct column corresponding to a given term. The calculator then uses these functions in tandem to continuously update a final resulting dictionary with all the tallies for a given cohort's terms. Lastly, the user has many options to see the results in raw numbers or percentages, separating graduate and enrolled tallies, and generating the date for single or multiple cohorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With this tool, my goal is for the retention report to be a matter of hours, not days or weeks.\n"

    "#### This tool's main purpose is to reduce the time and resources required to generate a retention report for the cohorts' timeline. The user's cohort file is turned into a list of lists and is appended a series of 1s, 0s, and 2s to identify retention in a given term. This information is then tallied using the retention_calculator function, a combination of various nested functions working together to produce tallies for every cohort's semester. The user can then see the results in percentages or raw numbers, in enrolled and graduated subgroups or a combined group tally, as well as run the calculator for multiple cohorts, which would essentially be saving time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I hope this tool can better assist the other three statisticians when this type of report is produced, as this is often the time when we need each other's help the most. I also hope that this tool reduces time consumption from weeks to hours. The time saved can be better spent on more pressing questions the many other stakeholders may have about the nature of retention itself as well as the students we are trying to retain."
